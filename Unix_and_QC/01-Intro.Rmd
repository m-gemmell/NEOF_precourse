This book contains information for pre course materials you can run through. These are not mandatory but highly recommended if you are unfamiliar or rusty with the topic materials.

There is a chapter for each topic. Each chapter will contain:

- A video presentation to introduce you to the topic and prime you for the book.
- A link to a book for the topic. This will contain further theory, practice, and exercises. You will need a webVNC link to carry out the practice and exercises.

If you are having any issues please ask for assistance via the main slack channel for the course you will be attending.
